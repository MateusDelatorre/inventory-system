		Resource representing a single item entry in a loot table with chance and amount ranges.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The LootItem resource represents an individual entry in a [Loot] table. It defines which item can be generated, its probability chance (0.0 to 1.0), and the range of amounts that can be generated.
		
		The chance value represents the independent probability of this item being selected, similar to the Minetest loot system. A chance of 0.5 means 50% probability, and 1.0 means 100% probability. The min_amount and max_amount define the range for random quantity generation when this item is selected.

		<member name="item_id" type="String" setter="set_item_id" getter="get_item_id" default="&quot;&quot;">
			The ID of the item that this loot entry represents. This should correspond to an [ItemDefinition] ID in the [InventoryDatabase].
		</member>
		<member name="max_amount" type="int" setter="set_max_amount" getter="get_max_amount" default="1">
			The maximum amount of this item that can be generated when this loot entry is selected. The actual amount will be randomly chosen between [member min_amount] and this value (inclusive).
		</member>
		<member name="min_amount" type="int" setter="set_min_amount" getter="get_min_amount" default="1">
			The minimum amount of this item that will be generated when this loot entry is selected. The actual amount will be randomly chosen between this value and [member max_amount] (inclusive).
		</member>
		<member name="chance" type="float" setter="set_chance" getter="get_chance" default="1.0">
			The probability chance (0.0 to 1.0) of this loot item being selected independently. A value of 0.5 represents a 50% chance, and 1.0 represents a 100% chance. This follows the Minetest loot system approach where each item has an independent probability rather than relative weights.
