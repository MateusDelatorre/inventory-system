	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The Loot resource represents a loot table containing a list of [LootItem] resources. It provides functionality for chance-based random selection of items, similar to the Minetest loot system, commonly used in survival games for treasure chests, enemy drops, and resource gathering. Each item has an independent probability of being selected during random generation.
		
		Unlike weight-based systems, each loot item has an independent chance (0.0 to 1.0) of being selected, allowing for more predictable probability calculations.

				Returns a randomly selected [LootItem] from the loot table based on independent chance probabilities. Each item is checked independently against its chance value (0.0 to 1.0). Returns null if no items pass their chance checks or if the loot table is empty.
